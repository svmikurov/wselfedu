"""Self-education exercise app package.

There are two approaches to performing exercises:

* self-education without incentives
* education using stimulation

Education using stimulation
---------------------------

Points are awarded for correct execution of the exercise. A limit has
been set on the number of points that can be received per day. From day
to day, the points received accumulate.

Points can be deducted, for example, when a parent rewards a child for
studying. This way, the child becomes motivated to do the exercises.
